# undo-push-experiment

Testing how can I revert an ooopps-push into a develop branch without breaking anything

### Possible approaches:

- Make a new branch cloning the other from last pushed commit (take care the history commits are still there)
- Revert last push (taking care of dont erasing my local changes)
